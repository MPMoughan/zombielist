Zombie Preparedness App a.k.a Zombie Survival Map

We've set out to create an app that could be more generally applied to disaster preparedness, but ours has a bit of an undead twist...we're going to help users prepare themselves for an impending zombie apocalypse!!!

What we want to give the user:
- Predaredness question list - part of user signup 
- Map of grocery stores, supply stores, weapon depots, and hidehouts
