Zombie Preparedness App a.k.a zombielist

We've set out to create an app that could be more generally applied to disaster preparedness, but ours has a bit of an undead twist...we're going to help users prepare themselves for an impending zombie apocalypse!!! 

Users in need of this products:
- Rick Grimes (The Walking Dead)

- List of necessary items 

Technology list
