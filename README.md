Zombie Survival Map
==========

Zombie Preparedness App a.k.a Zombie Survival Map

We've set out to create an app that could be more generally applied to disaster preparedness, but ours has a bit of an undead twist...we're going to help users prepare themselves for an impending zombie apocalypse!!! 

Users in need of this products:
- Rick Grimes (The Walking Dead) 
- Ana and Kenneth (Dawn of the Dead) 
- Shaun and Ed (Shaun of the Dead)
- Gerry Lane (World War Z) 

What we want to give the user:
- Predaredness question list - part of user signup 
- Map of grocery stores, supply stores, weapon depots, and hidehouts
- The ability to favorite locations to view later
- List of necessary items to buy
- emergency contact (twilio!)

Technology Stack
- Ruby on Rails
- Database - postgres
- AJAX and jQuery
- External APIs (Google Places, DataSF, Google Maps/Mapbox, Twilio(nice to have!))
- Frameworks --> Rails, Bootstrap/Foundations(?), and handlebars(?)

Models
- Min. 3 models
- user --> attributes?
- locations (favorites)
- items (favorites)
- 
Other...
-RSPEC - need to test certain functionality
-Views - map out our UX layout and User Login
-Data validation within forms (validates, flash messages, etc.) 
-Heroku - based on experience from project one


Possible ToDo's for Wednesday 11/19...just my 2 cents, but I think it would be good to at least cover these items before we really jump into any coding tomorrow.

-Scope. What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
-User stories. What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in Trello.
-Wireframes. Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
-Object Models. Draw out the model associations for your project.
-Milestones. Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.
